Configuration
=============

You can configure either a new or an existing survey.

#. Go to *Surveys* and choose an existing one or create it.
#. In the *Options* tab, *Questions* group, choose the *Next Survey*.

Now you'll have to configure the destination questions linked to this survey's questions.

#. Go to the *Answers* tab choose the linked question.
#. For simple/multiple choice qustions you'll have to link the answers as well.

Usage
=====

Once the survey is configured, the users can fill them up as usual. The answers in the
next survey will be prefilled according to the linked questions.

If the user changes any response in the next question, we can tell the difference in
the backend: go to the participation and in the answers tree let the column
*Diff with origin* show.
