Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Have basic permissions for both Resource Bookings and Surveys.
#. Link one survey to a resource booking type from *Resource Bookings > Types*.
#. Create a resource booking for that type.
#. Confirm it.
#. Use the contextual action *Invite to fill survey*. Can be used in multiple
   records at once in the list view.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* You cannot invite those that were already invited. Do that from the survey form.
