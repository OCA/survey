Once installed from the configuration of the questions, in the options, you can
indicate the allowed mime types (Allowed Filemimetypes) and the maximum file
size to upload (Max Filesize).

In addition to the binary option, a Multi: Binary option is supported which has
the same functionality as the single option but allows the user to add more than
one file.
