  for end-users. As all other rst files included in the README,
  it MUST NOT contain reStructuredText sections
  only body text (paragraphs, lists, tables, etc). Should you need
  a more elaborate structure to explain the addon, please create a
  Sphinx documentation (which may include this file as a "quick start"
  section). ]
