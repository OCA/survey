This module extends the functionality of survey to change the way the page and questions have to be created.
With default behaviour, you have 2 open 2 wizards to create questions, and those are created only once global survey is saved.
With this module, you only create survey and pages on the same form. You then create questions individually per page.
This module also adds a button on survey form with count of associated questions and list of these questions when clicked.
