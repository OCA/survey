This module allows to generate quotations from surveys submits.

Configuration
=============

You can configure either a new or an existing survey.

#. Go to *Surveys* and choose an existing one or create it.
#. In the *Options* tab, *Sales* group, set *Generate Quotations* on.
#. You can set your preferred sales team for the generated quotations.

Now you'll have to configure the products linked to the questions.

For *Numerical value* questions:

#. In the *Answers* tab choose the linked product.
#. The resulting quotation will have as many items of that product as the user defines.

For *Multiple choice: only one answer*:

#. In the *Answers* tab link a product to every given choice.
#. The resulting quotation will have the product linked to the survey user's choice.

For *Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed*:

#. In the *Answers* tab link a product to every given choice.
#. The resulting quotation will have the products linked to the survey user's choices.

When the survey is submited an internal message is generated in the resulting quotation
with a link to the user answers. Optionally, you can configure some of the questions so
their input values are shown in such message. This way it can be easier to track some
relevant infos concerning the request. To do so:

#. In the *Options* tab of the questions go to the *Sales* section.
#. Set *Show in sale order comment* on if you want those answers on the internal
   notification.

Usage
=====

Once the survey is configured, the users can fill them up as usual. The quotations will
be generated according to the survey users' choices.
