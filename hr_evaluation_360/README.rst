=================
Hr Evaluation 360
=================

In human resources or industrial psychology, 360-degree feedback,
also known as multi-rater feedback, multi source feedback, or
multi source assessment, is a process utilized by organizations
to solicit information from a variety of workplace sources on
an employee's work-related behavior and/or performance.

Most often, information solicited in a 360-degree feedback process
will include feedback from an employee's subordinates, peers
(colleagues), and supervisor(s), as well as a self-evaluation by
the employee him or herself. Such feedback can also include, when
relevant, feedback from external sources who interact with the
employee, such as customers and suppliers or other interested
stakeholders. 360-degree feedback is so named because it solicits
feedback regarding an employee's behavior from a variety of points
of view (subordinate, lateral, and supervisory). It therefore may
be contrasted with "downward feedback" (traditional feedback on
work behavior and performance delivered to subordinates by supervisory
or management employees only; see traditional performance appraisal),
or "upward feedback" delivered to supervisory or management employees
by subordinates only.
